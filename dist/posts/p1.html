        <p>I still remember when we got our first internet connection way back when I was in 4th grade. The engineer was fiddling with his tools, busy setting up the line. There was a buzz of excitement in the room, me and my brother eagerly looking on every little move he was making… WAITING! The modem light flickered, turning yellow to green, completed the dial-up, internet explorer running and BOOM! We became another node in the World Wide Web. Back then, like most kids my age, I had no clue what the internet does… I just knew if you entered something in the google search bar, relevant images and links would pop up. Funnily, from then on all my school projects seemed easy, but I always made sure I was not copying from the same place as my other friends. I now had every album of my favourite rock band and the latest movies on me, and it felt good to pass them around my class, to people, who still didn’t know what torrent was. But the internet was still very young at that time… even Facebook hadn’t launched (at least not in our country). Basically, much of the people weren’t on the network yet, cause at that time, it didn’t 
            offer that much value and of course, due to the lack of resources!
            </p><br>

        <p>For me personally, YouTube was the real game-changer, many people don’t know this but, YouTube initially started as a video version of an online dating service, the creators of YouTube started posting ads on craigslist asking attractive women to upload videos of themselves to YouTube in exchange for a $100 reward but, the difficulty in finding enough dating videos led to a change of plans, with site’s founders deciding to accept video uploads of all kinds. Lucky for me, Justin Bieber and millions around the world, it connected everyone in a way no one imagined. Visual cues being the strongest and most relatable, from there on it spread like wildfire. And with every new member sharing their own unique perspective and journey in life, whilst touching others in a small or significant way.  Success stories are too many to tell, but when you start to add value to people’s lives, you can be sure that many more are going to follow. The internet did just that!

        </p><br>
        <p>Fast forward to 2021, it has now become an indispensable part of our lives now. We can’t even imagine a day without it. But I am not here to tell you about that, we all know how important it is. What I want to throw light on is its ability to act as a great leveller. Let me explain... Say you were born in the 19th or 20th century and you wanted to develop or learn a particular skill say cooking or learning to play the guitar, could be anything, leaving aside your economic conditions (cause that matters too of course) for a while. You still had to find a mentor and be around someone who could teach you the craft, at least initially, someone to smoothen your way, and depending on his/her own mastery, and on the availability around, could basically make or break your own foundation of it. Natural talent alone, in my opinion, does not truly suffice, environment 
            matters too. 1% are freaks, to be honest, leave them aside. Mozart was one of them, but did it help him to be born in the house of composer and an experienced teacher? Most definitely! For every genius we gain, we lose about 10 due to the conditions. You had to be in the right place at the right time. After all, people are the end product of the experiences they have in life. 
            </p><br>

        <p>But here we have this unique platform, transcending every social and cultural barrier that existed, it allows you to be anything you ever wanted to be. It might seem trivial considering every bum on the road now has a smartphone making it extremely easy to overlook its true potential. Honestly, I don’t have the full picture either. Who knows how far we can stretch it! So, Recently on YouTube, I came across this guy named Abhinav Chhikara, an UI/UX designer. In one of his videos, He put it very aptly. He gave the analogy of the internet as a whole city with lots of people living inside it. With you belonging to one part of that city, but you would never know about the other parts of the city or have the idea of the whole scope of the city unless you explore it, internet works similarly, the scope here is almost endless but, it is easy for us to get used to that one particular area, thereby neglecting a world of possibilities out there. You see I don’t even know that guy, but still, he had an impact on me, made me think for a while, and maybe changed my perspective a little. That’s the power of the internet. It is so much more complex than you think it is.

        </p><br>
        <p>Even small things like discovering new music, say a new artist, maybe listening to his lyrics make you see the world differently, gives you that ray of hope, that push you needed then, who knows!? We got ourselves a whole another world here. And like all things, it has its vices and cons too. You have your choices, our ancestors didn’t 
            have them, but we don’t have any excuses left!
